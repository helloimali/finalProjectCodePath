## Overview
### Description
In general this app is a simple concept that can have many different small implementations. The general idea is to have a social media platform, a combination of Instagram and Tinder, for pet owners to create for their dogs. This app will serve as a tool for "dogs" to post and like other dogs that are in their area so that they can make friends and chat with dogs. These dogs can then plan and become friends in person. The app will have the general social media abilities of posting, liking and commenting along with Tinder like features like swiping right and left and liking other profiles.
